This repository contains the full analysis, data processing, and insights from my Master's thesis, which explores the relationship between sleep quality (including duration and disturbances) and the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) across different age and gender groups.

## 📘 Thesis Title
**Does sleep quality such as duration and disturbances correlate with the incidence of myocardial infarction across different age groups and genders?**

## 🧪 Overview

This study investigates whether poor sleep quality may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk, particularly heart attacks, using real-world health data. It includes:

- Literature review on sleep and heart health
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Correlation matrices
- Statistical testing (t-tests)
- Logistic regression modeling
- Key insights segmented by age and gender

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle environment)
- Dataset from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- No strong correlation between sleep quality and MI in the general population
- Statistically significant correlation found in males aged 40–60 with sleep disturbances
- Age and BMI were more predictive of MI than sleep variables in the logistic regression model
- Sleep disturbance and sleep efficiency are strongly inversely correlated
